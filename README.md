# Datasets and scripts for the paper Compositionally constrained sites drive long branch attraction

In this repository all the necessary code and datasets have been uploaded to reproduce the results described in the paper Compositionally constrained sites drive long branch attraction and to run the introduced CAT-PMSF pipeline on arbitary datasets.

Structure of the repository:
- [datasets](datasets/) : empirical datasets analysed in the paper
- [scripts](scripts/) : scripts necessary to perform CAT-PMSF pipeline an a dataset
- [step1_iqtree_lg](step1_iqtree_lg/) : results of CAT-PMSF's 1st step applied on the empirical datasets
- [step2_pb](step2_pb/) : results of CAT-PMSF's 2nd step applied on the empirical datasets
- [step3_iqtree](step3_iqtree/): : results of CAT-PMSF's 3rd step applied on the empirical datasets
